Development Environment

You may choose to create your project in the workspace we provide here, or if you wish to develop your project locally, you will need to set up your environment properly as described below:

    Spark 2.4.3
    Scala 2.11.x
    Java 1.8.x
    Kafka build with Scala 2.11.x
    Python 3.6.x or 3.7.x

Environment Setup (Only Necessary if You Want to Work on the Project Locally on Your Own Machine)
For Macs or Linux:

    Download Spark from https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. Choose "Prebuilt for Apache Hadoop 2.7 and later."
    Unpack Spark in one of your folders (I usually put all my dev requirements in /home/users/user/dev).
    Download binary for Kafka from this location https://kafka.apache.org/downloads, with Scala 2.11, version 2.3.0. Unzip in your local directory where you unzipped your Spark binary as well. Exploring the Kafka folder, you’ll see the scripts to execute in bin folders, and config files under config folder. You’ll need to modify zookeeper.properties and server.properties.
    Download Scala from the official site, or for Mac users, you can also use brew install scala, but make sure you download version 2.11.x.
    Run below to verify correct versions:

    java -version
    scala -version

    Make sure your ~/.bash_profile looks like below (might be different depending on your directory):

    export SPARK_HOME=/Users/dev/spark-2.4.3-bin-hadoop2.7
    export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home
    export SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala/
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$SPARK_HOME/bin:$SCALA_HOME/bin:$PATH
